# GAPtomated
This GitHub repository contains a Python-based tool designed to automate the gap analysis between existing organizational policies and ISO 27001 requirements. It reads policies from PDF and DOCX files, preprocesses the text, compares it with ISO 27001 requirements, identifies gaps, and saves the results to a CSV file.
